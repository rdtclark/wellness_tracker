# Wellbeing app


Our wellbeing app is aimed towards individuals who want to track how they were feeling over a set period of time.

We will ask basic questions and evaluate on their answers to determine what made their day good/bad and suggest based on their answers, what actions are positive influences and what actions are negative.


## MVP

Ask the user basic set up questions to do with 5 aspects in their life; sleeping, eating, social, and both mental and physical exercise.

((have multiple examples of the same question so the questions appear more random))

Ask how they felt yesterday was after answering the above questions or, how the feel the day has gone.


User can score questions

User can input a reason for good day/bad day
